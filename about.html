			<h2>Graham Schmuland</h2>
			<h3>A bit of history</h3>
			<p>I was born and lived in Calgary for 22 years. During that time I discover my passion for good design
			and using the computer to solve intricate problems. Through junior high and high school I picked up tidbits 
			on website development, making several along the way.</p>
			<p>During this time I also pursued a bit of graphic design. Through the process of experimenting with and learning 
			new techniques, I saw large growth of my design capabilities as well as the quality of my products. I have had a 
			few clients along the way while I was practicing my skills as a hobby. At this point I am more focused on personal 
			projects as I enjoy the challenge of the combination of design and coding those projects bring.</p>
			<p>Currently I am studying Computer Science at Dalhousie University. This oppotunity is allowing me to reinforce 
			the foundation that I had from personal experience. I absolutely love it so far and can't wait to experience 
			working in the industry after my degree. I am also on the varsity volleyball team at Dalhousie and love the group 
			of guys that I get to practice with on a daily basis.</p>
			<h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
			<p>When I am not studying for that midterm or at practice there are a few things I like to do in my spare time.
			One thing I like to do as a stress reliever is produce music. It is a hobby I have been working on for a few years and 
			enjoy the process of creating sounds and then building those into songs. </p>
			<p>I am also very much into competitive gaming. Right now my main game is Rocket League where I have climbed into 
			the top 1% of players. I love being able to grow in technical and strategic skill within a game and with Rocket League 
			being a new game it has been cool to be apart of the shaping of a new esport.</p>
			<p>I also love to go snowboarding. Unfortunately there isn't much snowboarding available where I am going to school, 
			but when I get back to Calgary a trip to the Rockies is always in the schedule.</p>
			<h3>Where do I see myself in 5-10 years?</h3>
			<p>There are two goals I am striving for over the next decade. In 5 years I will be fresh out of university looking 
			to make my mark in the industry. Hopefully by then I will have released a few apps on the marketplace and will use 
			that as a side project. </p>
			<p>But before I am able to rely on my own products to support myself I see myself working at a studio for a few years. 
			I think regardless of my situation with any entreprenuerial ventures I might have, working at a reputable studio or 
			startup company would be invaluable experience. From both a programming and design aspect of growth but also 
			contributing to a larger goal as a team and company.</p>
