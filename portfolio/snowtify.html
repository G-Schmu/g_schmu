		<h1>Snowtify Prototype</h1>
		<p><i>Graphic Design and Prototyping</i></p>
		
		<p>Conceptualized and prototyped at various fidelities, Snowtify is an app created as a final project for a course.
		The course required that a group of students come up with an app idea and the go through the process of iterative 
		prototyping to test the functionality and design.</p>
		<p>The app began as a series of sketches and was later developed into a HTML image map prototype. The concept, logo, 
		and layout were created by me with tweaks and suggestions from other members of the group.</p>
		<p>The logo quickly came to fruition as the idea was very simple to implements yet strong in its impact. What is commonly 
		used as a share icon was positioned to create a snowflake effect surrounding a music note. This is representative of the 
		purpose of the app to share the music you enjoy to the people around you, specifically in a winter setting.</p>
		<p>The idea of the app is to share playlists that play based off geographic position. Originally intended to be used 
		at ski resorts for specific runs, the app can be adapted to be usable in any location.</p>
